# Robust nonlinear model predictive control of continuous crystallization using Bayesian last layer surrogate models
This repository provides the code for the conference paper "Robust nonlinear model predictive control of continuous crystallization using Bayesian last layer surrogate models".
For questions about these materials we kindly ask you to send an e-mail at collin.johnson@tu-dortmund.de.

Training of data-based models is performed using the method shown in "F. Fiedler and S. Lucia (2023). Improved Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Networks With Bayesian Last Layer. IEEE Access, 11, 123149â€“123160", https://github.com/4flixt/2023_Paper_BLL_LML/ based on Tensorflow/Keras.

The robust multi-stage NMPC algorithm uses the package do-mpc based on CasADi and IPOPT.

This repository is currently still in construction.

Steps:
1. Generate simulation data in "Data generation"
